If you select "Yes," the existing scores will be re-scaled so students' Course Grade, e.g., B- (80%), does not change.<br><br>\
If you select "No," when the item's max points changes, all the item's existing scores will remain unchanged. This will change students' Course Grade; e.g., B- (80%) becomes C (75%).

changingPointsRecalculatesGrades = Changing the max points value for an assignment will require any scores that have been previously entered for that \
	assignment to be recalculated. For example, if the value was 10 and is changed to 20, then a student score of 9 will become an 18. Note that reducing the \
	max points will result in a loss of grading precision due to the need for rounding. 

confirmChangingWeightEquallyWeighted = This item is a member of a category that is set to equally weight its members. If you want to change the percent \
