INSTALLATION

Currently, it should build against a vanilla 2.5.x branch sakai. You will need to take the following actions:

(1) Run the sql script under client/src/sql/oracle/gb-datamodel-changes.sql against your sakai database (or set auto.ddl to true).
(2) Apply the patch labeled gb-2-5-x.patch under the original gradebook module.
(3) Apply the patch labeled sam-2-5-x.patch under the sam module.
(4) Check out this project as "gradebook2" and add it as a module under your sakai pom.xml for the active profile.
(5) Under your sakai profile in .m2/settings.xml set the <gwt.platform> tag to linux, mac, or windows (only tested on linux and mac so far).
(6) Optional: Configure Export Advisor by specifying which bean to inject. This is in the applicationContext.xml file via the placeholderConfig spring bean.


In other words, at your sakai base directory:
> svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/gradebook2/tags/Test-Tag-2-5-x-QA-10 gradebook2
> cd gradebook
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/gb-2-5-x.patch
> cd ../sam
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/sam-2-5-x.patch
> cd ../
> vi pom.xml (and edit to include "gradebook2" as a module)
> cd gradebook2
> mvn install sakai:deploy
