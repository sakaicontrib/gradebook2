DEVELOPER SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file provides some basic information for developers to set up their
development environment to make modifications to the Gradebook 2 project. In
order to simply build and deploy the project in Sakai, refer to the
"sakai/[version]/INSTALL.txt" file. 


RUNNING DEVELOPMENT MODE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're in a 64 bit OS, you'll need to use a 32 bit Java for the Run
command. 

Our suggestion is that you use the Google Plugin with Eclipse with GWT 2+. This is a 
standard Eclipse plugin, with update sites at the following locations:

Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo)
http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.5

Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede)
http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.4

Eclipse 3.3 (Europa)
http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.3


You will also need to include the following VM args in the Run Configuration:

-Xmx1028m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=400m -Dgb2.security=false -Dgb2.mode=hosted -Dgb2.role=admin -Dgb2.config.gb2.enable.scaled.extra.credit=admin -Dgb2.config.gb2.limit.scaled.extra.credit=categories -Dgb2.config.gb2.gradable.role.names=Student,access -Dgb2.config.enabled.grade.types=POINT,PERCENT,LETTER


Finally, you will need to configure your browser to support GWT development mode. In Firefox, simply install the GWT Developer Plugin for Firefox:
